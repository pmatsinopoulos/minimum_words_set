Given a set of words ww, let's find the minimum set of words the letters of which comprise the whole
alphabet used for the whole words set.

For example, if words are:

abcd
bcd
cd
xy
wz

Then, the minimum set of words is:

wz
xy
abcd

We want to create a function F as follows: 

F: input: ww, which is the whole set of words. Note. The whole set of words comprises the letters set L.
   output: r, which is a subset of ww that contains the minimum set of words from ww that have letters from the whole set L.
                     
F(ww) => r

Given F(ww) => r can I calculate the F(ww + w). Where ww + w is the previous set of words ww with a new word w.

F(ww + w) 
    if w has all letters that belong to L (L being the letter set of ww)
       then F(ww + w) == F(ww)
       Is this the minimum?
       The words are ww + w. If F(ww) is not the minimum set then this means that 
       w adds some letters to the whole set, which is not the case.
       
    if w has some letters that belong to L and some that they do not belong to L
       then F(ww + w) => F(ww) + w - {the words from F(ww) that they do not contribute any new letter any more}
       Is this the minimum? If this is not the minimum then this means that I can remove
       a word and I still have the same letter set. If I remove the w, then I don't have the
       same letter set. If I remove any more of the other words in F(ww), then that word means it has the
       same letters like w, which is not the case. Hence, this is the minimum set.
       
    if w has all letters not being part of L
       then F(ww + w) => F(ww) + w
       Is this the minimum? If this is not the minimum, then I can remove a word and have the minimum
       set. If I remove w, then I will not cover for the letters of w. If I remove any of the words
       F(ww), then the characters of this word are not covered by the newly added word w.
